00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,840
Hello, and welcome to another episode of ZAP Chat with me, Simon Bennetts, and Yiannis.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,360
Hello.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,800
So this week we are carrying on with the automation framework. I think we've got quite a few more

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,240
episodes on the automation framework. It's a big thing, lots going on, and it seems to

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,760
be quite useful to go into each of the jobs in some detail.

6
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,880
Which one are we looking at this week, Simon?

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,480
So last week we did the environment, the passiveScan-config job, and the alertFilter job.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,720
And I'm kind of trying to go through them in kind of logical order, the order you would

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:51,920
actually set them up. So what I'll do is I will share my screen again, and I'll start

10
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,220
off with the ZAP documentation

11
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:59,860
zaproxy.org, because this is, you know, if you want to check it,

12
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,760
you know, have a look at anything, see the details, there's loads of information here.

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:12,340
So for the automation framework, go to documentation, then automate, and automation framework.

14
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,800
And you can see now we've actually got all of the jobs here, the environment, and the

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,380
jobs there in alphabetical order.

16
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,200
But what I'll do now is switch to ZAP.

17
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:33,420
And I will, what I'll do is I'm just going to move certain windows out of the way so

18
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,220
I can see what I'm doing.

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,020
I'm just going to launch a browser to sort of bring up BodgeIt, nice, simple application.

20
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:49,000
And that just allows me to add that to the context, which just speeds things up a touch.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,920
Including context, I'll have a new context, which we will automatically call BodgeIt.

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:03,280
So what I'll do is we're going to have a look, so I'm going to create a new plan.

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,220
And so we've talked about the, so I'm going to use the BodgeIt context, that's what we

24
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,620
talked about, the alertFilter, the passiveScan-config.

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:18,320
So the next logical ones are the requestor script, replacer script and requestor jobs.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,720
Now I'm not going to cover the script job yet.

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,420
That's one for a future episode, because it's probably going to be an episode all on its

28
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,200
own.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,320
There's a lot going on there, even without going into all the details of scripts.

30
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,020
So let's just talk about the replacer and requestor jobs.

31
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,700
Now I'm actually going to start off with the requestor job because the replacer job doesn't

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,920
do anything unless something else is working.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,820
So let's just start with the requestor job.

34
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,420
So.. When we look at the requestor, all that it is as a job.

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,300
It's basically a job that sends a request and receives a response, right?

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,300
Just to demystify.

37
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,300
Exactly.

38
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,300
Very simple.

39
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,300
And actually, I mean, if I run it like that, it will actually do nothing because the requestor

40
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,820
job actually allows you, that's the environment, the requestor job allows you to define a set

41
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,820
of requests.

42
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,380
And by default, there are none because we don't know what you want to request. Right.

43
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,300
So the first tab, you can change the job name, which is kind of useful.

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,440
If you've got lots of requestor jobs, you want to make sure you want to see which one's

45
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,860
doing what.

46
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,260
And we have an option for an authenticated user.

47
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,980
It's not available to us because we haven't defined an authenticated user and that's something

48
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:38,740
we'll cover in a future episode.

49
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,920
So the requests.

50
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,080
We'll add a request and we can actually choose from the sites tree if we don't have to.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,500
So let's just select that one.

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,180
And you see we can define the method.

53
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Define the 

54
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,140
HTTP version.

55
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,800
And we've got a result code here option.

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,720
So say we are expecting a 200.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,300
And that's kind of, I mean, you don't have to specify that.

58
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,280
If you don't specify it, then we won't do any checks at all.

59
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,740
So actually, let's just not put that in.

60
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,940
Let's just save that and run that.

61
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,420
And nothing seems to happen, but we go to the history tab.

62
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,740
We will see, well, first of all, we have these requests from the, when I launched a browser,

63
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:30,780
but then we've got this request here and we'll see it actually doesn't do much because

64
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
it's returning a 302.

65
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
So we're getting a redirect.

66
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:43,120
And that's one of the reasons why we have this option to actually say what response

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,140
code we expect.

68
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,700
So if you're saying, okay, we are expecting a 200, save that, run the plan, then you'll

69
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,740
see, we actually get a warning.

70
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,740
And you have a look at the output tab

71
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,740


72
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,960
different in response code values

73
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
for message.

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,500
That looks like something we ought to translate in something more useful maybe, but we can

75
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,160
see we expected 200 and received a 302.

76
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Yeah, exactly.

77
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,160
Exactly.

78
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,800
We're expecting the page back and we're getting a redirect, right?

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Exactly.

80
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
So we can now change that.

81
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,460
We can go, okay, so we're requesting the wrong URL.

82
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,460


83
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460


84
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,460


85
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,460


86
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,460


87
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,460


88
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,460
And we go in and 

89
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:34,780
modified that. So put a slash on there, save, save and rerun. And then we'll now see we actually

90
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:42,680
got something sensible back. So we got the kind of data we're expecting. Yeah. So that's nice and

91
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:49,640
easy. There are some extra options we have. I'm obviously, let's have a look.

92
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:58,260
Well, we've got another tab here with headers. So we can actually add specific headers. So, sorry.

93
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:09,460
What I like about this is as one example, you could specify a couple of different browser

94
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:16,240
headers, right? Your browser could be both Safari and Chrome. Yeah. And then you see what actually

95
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,080
is the response to the website and how it's configured. Yeah.

96
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,580
So, and we've run this, have a look at the history and look at it. We will then see the

97
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:31,160
request. We've now got the test header and test value. Now I think this job is, I mean, this is

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,080
probably not a job you would be using for finding vulnerabilities. This is very much if you need to

99
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:46,280
make a request to do something specific. I mean, one example is with something like Juice Shop.

100
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,360
If you're testing at one, I mean, this is what we've done before.

101
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:55,500
Is say you want to do authenticated tests against an application and you actually have to create

102
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,220
the user. So if something on Juice Shop, I would actually make a set of requests to one or more

103
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:05,520
requests to register a user so that when I bring the application up by default, make these requests

104
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,240
to add the user. And then we've got the user there to make the request to actually do things.

105
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,980
Or say, if you know that the spider or something doesn't find a particular URL that you do need

106
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,880
to hit, then you could put this job in.

107
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,080
And then it would actually hit the URLs you need.

108
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:30,100
One use case that comes to mind is real quickly checking what kind of cookies I get back.

109
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,680
Yeah.

110
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,060
And whether or not I get those cookies when I vary the headers.

111
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:35,940
Yeah.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,480
And that's really important in the context of have any other cookies which are not part of the current session.

113
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,660
Are they being issued without us knowing?

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,080
Yeah.

115
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,480
And of course, we've...

116
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,320
We do have job tests, so we can actually put tests in to see, to double check the results and that's

117
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
something we'll cover in another episode as well.

118
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,200
So we can actually say, okay, let's add another request and we'll...

119
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Let's go...

120
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,220
This time I'll make a post request and...

121
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,520
A little bit of data.

122
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,000
Yeah.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,400
So this, and we won't bother adding any headers this time.

124
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:28,760
So now I'll just clear the session so we can see the requests more easily.

125
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:35,200
And remember that doesn't clear the automation framework plan so that we can do this kind of testing.

126
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,760
And we'll see in the...

127
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,560
Now we've made this request.

128
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:46,440
So we've got the test header there and in the post, we don't have the test header because we didn't add it.

129
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,560
And we've got the data there.

130
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,020
Well, one header that has been added is the content lenght.

131
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,320
Otherwise it wouldn't be a valid post request, right?

132
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,800
Exactly.

133
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,020
So that will do these things for you.

134
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:57,920
Yeah.

135
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,180
So that's the requestor.

136
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,300
Nice and simple.

137
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,700
But the reason I did that one first before the replacer is we've now got something we can actually use the replacer on.

138
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,520
So let's add the replacer job.

139
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:24,140
And what we'll see is, again, this is one which has a set of rules.

140
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,980
Now the replacer is a tool within ZAP.

141
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,540
So this is one of the standard ZAP tools, and it allows you to replace things.

142
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,820
And it's not a kind of fuzzer.

143
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,160
It doesn't do anything on its own.

144
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,860
So it doesn't matter how many replacer jobs you add.

145
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,200
It's only, they only take effect when they apply to something.

146
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,440
So let's have a look.

147
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:53,440
What we've got here is we can add a replacement rule and we can put in, so put in the URL.

148
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,460
Now this is optional.

149
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:59,120
Actually, if you see here, we have help for this dialogue.

150
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:03,340
So, and I think this is actually the standard help for the replacer.

151
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,160
It applies to the standard replacer job and the standard replacer tool, not just the, the automation framework job.

152
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,180
So it gives you lots of help there.

153
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:24,100
And you will see things like the URL is actually a regex and applies to all messages if it's empty.

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,140
So we don't have to apply, apply that.

155
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,180
So what we've got is we have match type.

156
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,960
So we've got a set of options here, so we can replace the request header.

157
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,920
And in this case, it will add the header.

158
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:45,160
If it doesn't exist, then we can replace a string in the request, the body, and then the same for the responses

159
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:52,120
so we can put a header in and replace individual strings in the header and body as well.

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,860
So let's go for the request header.

161
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:10,060
And what I'll do is to, and we'll put in another writing, right.

162
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,300
Yeah.

163
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,920
And we will save that.

164
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,860
Oh, I've got to provide a description.

165
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,460


166
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:25,840
So... I think it's important for our listener Simon to always, before you set up such a match type to know what you're expecting, right.

167
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,380
As a result.

168
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,100
Absolutely.

169
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,900
Definitely.

170
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:35,200
Now you'll see, we automatically added the replace a job higher up before the requestor.

171
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,280
Now this might not be what you want.

172
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,160
If you've got several jobs, say you want to actually do something, then change the replace the rules.

173
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,840
So you might have to move this around.

174
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,340
And you can have as many

175
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,020
replace from requested jobs as you want.

176
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,180
You don't just have to have one.

177
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,240
So let's clear the session again and run that.

178
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,520
And hopefully we'll see that we've got the first request.

179
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:07,080
We've got the test header that we put in on that particular request, and now we've got the test header too.

180
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,480
And with the second request, we've got the test just to the test header too.

181
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,040
So if you want to actually

182
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,040
just put in one particular header on one request, then you might as well do it on that request.

183
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:29,820
But the place of job is a great way to actually apply to all of these things, all of the requests.

184
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,720
Now you don't have to do that.

185
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,680
So say the, we actually, oh, no, I meant to give them to the replacer.

186
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,880
Say we don't with this.

187
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,000
We don't want to apply it to the to all

188
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,060
of the jobs.

189
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,760
We actually just want to apply it to the post one.

190
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:59,100
So let's say something like make it easy for myself by copying this..Copy pasting the post URL.

191
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,000
Yep.

192
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,380
So effectively what this will do is it will only apply the replacer job when the specific URL is being hit.

193
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,440
Yeah.

194
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,300
Well, that's what you'd think, wouldn't you?

195
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,940
So I'm going to run this.

196
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,580
And we may see something unexpected.

197
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,000
We will actually see that we're still getting the test header, both test header in the get request. Uh interesting!

198
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,060
Yeah.

199
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,520
I tried this and it was like, oh, what's what's going on.

200
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,420
Then I remembered.

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,820
So that's why I, it was a deliberate mistake.

202
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,460
I may make some undelivered mistakes soon.

203
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:44,880
But if you actually have a look at the replacer, you'll see delete existing rules. Ahhhh.

204
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,320
Now this is very deliberate.

205
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,420
So what's happened is it, this is a standard, we have a standard replacer option.

206
00:13:51,900 --> 00:14:00,220
And what you'll see is we now have a set of replacer rules, including the original one that I added.

207
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,400
And this applies to everything.

208
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,640
So what we're doing is we're adding replacer rules to ZAP.

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:14,940
And so what I want to do is I actually want to delete the existing rules, but we don't have that as by default, because if you're

210
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,460
doing manual testing, you might have set up a whole set of replacer rules and you don't want to actually get rid of them.

211
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:27,060
So, you know, if you have this, this is a kind of hint to go, okay, maybe you want to use a separate configurations list.

212
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,780
And if you're actually doing automation, chances are you're launching a new instance of ZAP with new configuration.

213
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,640
So you don't need to delete the existing rules.

214
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,180
So that's why we don't have this as on by default.

215
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
So let's enable that.

216
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,520
A key message here for our listeners.

217
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:51,660
Always check all the replacer rules that you have in the context of ZAP as part of your, your context, right?

218
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:51,900
Yeah.

219
00:14:52,020 --> 00:15:01,260
And always double check what you, what's what you've, how you've configured the automation plans, that they're doing what you expect because you might say, okay, this makes sense.

220
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,660
But it still doesn't work the way you want because of other reasons, which we think are sensible.

221
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:14,460
But you might not have thought of, so let's have a look here and yes, we now don't have the,

222
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,300
we only have the test header on the post request and not on the get request.

223
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,680
Right, right.

224
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,460
So Simon, what other options are available within the requester in terms of matching strings?

225
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,420
Yeah, sure.

226
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:35,520
So, we've got some, lots of fun ones here, so let's have a look at this.

227
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,500
Well, let's add another rule actually, to make it clear.

228
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,460
So we have whole set of different match types.

229
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,520
And we can match.

230
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,400
So one of the things is nice and obvious.

231
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,640
We can see, we can change things in the response body.

232
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,800
So let's match a string.

233
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,960
So Bodg.*t and that is a regex.

234
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,100
So, so in this case we're saying, we need description when we.

235
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:19,800
So this is a BodgeIt store

236
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,460
so what I'm aiming to do is trying to replace every instance of BodgeIt, with "HackedIt".

237
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:37,200
And this is in the response body and let's save that and we will clear our session.

238
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,020
And this is where we'll see whether I've made any typos.

239
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,400
So we have a look at the response.

240
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:56,160
And then the packed it, and you'll actually see that it's probably it's replaced too much because we've got, we've actually replaced some of the title there.

241
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,240
So.. Closing bracket gone, right?

242
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,020
Exactly.

243
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,820
So yeah, try these things out

244
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,880
and you will see way.. Which is absolutely valid that was the regex that you specified.

245
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,640
Exactly.

246
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,680
And this might have been what I wanted to do.

247
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:14,100
It wasn't, but, that's

248
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,420
how it works out.

249
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:25,860
So let's put in, save that and run it again and look at this one and the, yeah.

250
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,860
So now we've got the "HackedIt" store and we haven't messed up the title so we can do regex expressions.

251
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:38,340
And one fun thing you can do, have a look at this.

252
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,840
So one thing you'll see this token processing, what does that mean?

253
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:55,180
Well, we actually have a set of built-in tokens, which allow you to replace things so we can actually, we've got UUID, ticks, min, max.

254
00:17:55,420 --> 00:18:00,520
So let's put in a UUID and we can copy and paste these things.

255
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:06,700
So replacement, we will actually put the UUID in and we would just get that string in there.

256
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,920
Let's put token replacement in, save that and run this again.

257
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,720
And this time.

258
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:13,840


259
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,600
We should see, we should have a UUID in there so we can do all sorts of fun things.

260
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:30,340
Now, one of the thing I haven't mentioned yet is have a look at this.

261
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,700
So we don't, I haven't actually mentioned the initiators.

262
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:42,940
So the initiators means this allows us to change which initiators, where the requests come from.

263
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:43,820


264
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:53,340
So which, which of those, which of the tools within ZAP, this rule applies to, in this by default applies to all HTTPS messages.

265
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
We can say, actually, we don't want that.

266
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,020
We will just get it to say, apply to the spider.

267
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:10,960
So we will apply it to the spider and just to double check, this is now working as we expect with the manual request.

268
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,840
We will try that out and have a look.

269
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,640
And yeah, it's still the BodgeIt store.

270
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:29,660
And so I'll need to do now is add another job and we'll talk about the spider job in more detail later, but this is just to demonstrate it and I won't give any other information there.

271
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,800
So I will run the plan, see the spiders finished.

272
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:42,880
Now we don't put the spider job, the spider requests in history because that kind of floods it really, particularly doing manual testing.

273
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:43,720


274
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,760
But if we have a look at the spider tab, that's all integrated and here we can just see, we can, by default, you'll see the URLs.

275
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,600
We can go to the URL to the messages and hopefully, yeah, we can see we've got the spider job.

276
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,160
We're now getting the UUID in the response replacement.

277
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,440
Yeah.

278
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
Within the spider job.

279
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,940
I think just going back on, on regex is really important.

280
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
A rule that I learned a long, long time ago back then.

281
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,480
Pearl.

282
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:19,780
Was being used instead of Python showing my age on, try out your regex on command line.

283
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,200
Right.

284
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,100
We're probably showing our, our years now, but please try out your regexes on command line.

285
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:26,360
Right.

286
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,820
And don't try them out on a language that is complex with passing command line regexes.

287
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:34,600
For example, don't try them out on Java because you've got to escape everything.

288
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,080
Right.

289
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,040
Out the regex in Python, make sure it works.

290
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,220
And when you're sure that it works, then go and specify it within

291
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:52,040
ZAP or specify in ZAP and try it out, you know, always, you know, this, and I think some people are a bit frightened of regexes.

292
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,460
They are absolutely an absolutely essential skill.

293
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,960
If you work in security, so many tools use regexes.

294
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,980
You don't necessarily have to be a regex expert.

295
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:12,780
There are, you know, I will go on, you know, there are online tools where you can check your reg, you know, complex regex expressions against different

296
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:19,220
payloads and things because it's, I'm not a regex expert, but I use regexes a lot.

00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:27,140
And there's lots of places in ZAP where we use regexes just because they are so flexible and so powerful.

298
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:39,280
So yeah, the other message apart from, you know, how you actually use, use these jobs in the automation framework is get a hat, get a good grip of regexes, play around with them and understand them properly.

299
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,120
And on that note, it's probably enough for this.

300
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:59,960
This session and next time I think we'll be, we'll be carrying on with the automation framework and we'll, I think it's time we've got onto the other exploring type jobs with the APIs and whether we get onto the spiders or not, I don't know, but we will keep pressing ahead.

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:11,000
