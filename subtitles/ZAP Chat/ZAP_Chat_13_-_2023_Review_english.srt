00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,120
Hello, and welcome to the first ZAP Chat of 2024. Happy New Year to everyone.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,440
Hello, Happy New Year.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,600
Here's Yiannis and myself chatting about ZAP stuff. Now, I had a quick chat and we decided that it

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,480
would be good to have a little review of 2023. So probably going to do a blog post about this as

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,120
well. So you might actually be watching this in the blog post. So you'll be able to see all the

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,840
best links. But I was just going to go through the year and we'll chat about the stuff that we got

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,640
done. What a year it has been. Very exciting year, right?

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,600
It's been a very exciting year and a very busy one. So lots got done.

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,120
January started off, we were very much focusing on authentication. So actually released the

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,840
authentication helper. It didn't have all the functionality it does now, but it allowed you to

11
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:06,480
automatically identify authentication requests and then automatically configure ZAP to handle

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,800
them. And this is something which was new for us because previously it was just like you had to

13
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,560
configure everything. ZAP could handle pretty much anything as long as you told ZAP how to handle it.

14
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,760
And in some cases you didn't know how to do that, which is kind of fair enough. So this was the

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:28,480
start of really getting ZAP to help you configure things more easily, particularly around authentication.

16
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,160
And that's something we intend to carry on through the year and hope to carry on even further.

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,520
In February, I went to OWASP AppSec Israel, where myself, Ricardo and Rick were all given

18
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,720
OWASP's Lifetime Achievement Awards, which is a little bit ironic given the events later on,

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
but those weren't taken off us. So we still got those, which is very nice to have those

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:04,960
recognition. But then, yeah, carry on in March and basically we're carrying on a lot more about

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,200
the authentication. So supported browser-based authentication, which I think is absolutely key

22
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:18,640
for modern web applications. We tried various things and as the Yiannis has told you, it's really

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,240
hard to authenticate to modern apps if you don't use the browser. There are some cases I've managed

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,400
to inject user sessions into a browser. You launch a browser, you inject the session and it works.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,400
But it's very application specific and quite a few applications, I've not found a way to do it.

26
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,080
It is. It's even considered a security feature by some. I mean, it's not really a security feature

27
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,840
because of course the asynchronous JavaScript is a client-side control. So therefore, theoretically,

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,880
it cannot be trusted. Having said that, it does add a layer of obfuscation,

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,480
for the lack of a better word, when it comes to getting that valid set of jsessionid,

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,560
or .NET cookies or whatever the technology might be behind that. So it is going to be,

31
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,480
I think, an ever-evolving game of cat and mouse between authentication that continues to evolve.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,320
If you look at the next versions of OAuth and so on, we've got that coming down the pipeline.

33
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,680
And then the security tools and ZAP at the forefront of web application and API security

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,280
tools trying to catch up with the latest authentication trends.

35
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:35,840
Yeah. And we know that authentication and automation oppose each other in some

36
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,400
ways because a lot of people who are doing bad things will use automation. So a lot of security

37
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,840
controls are there to prevent things that you need to do with ZAP if you want to automate your

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,160
security testing. So it's kind of tricky. And this is something we've always struggled with,

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,080
and it will continue to get more interesting. But we're getting there.

40
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,640
And the authenticating with the browser has proved very effective,

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,000
unless you use Gmail, in which case Chrome blocks you from doing that. So hey,

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,720
that's the way it goes.

43
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,000
I think one of the key takeaways for our listeners and learners is,

44
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,320
long gone are the days of you would send a get request or a post request,

45
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,560
and it would be a bunch of parameters. And all you have to do is to get the content length

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,760
right, and then you'd be able to, I don't know, brute force the interface.

47
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,840
And of course, this is not something that we're going to shy away from in the new protocols,

48
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,760
because overall, we have the same problem with CSRF tokens. And then it was just about generating

49
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,760
the sequence request. So I think it's just a case of evolving the tool set to catch up with the

50
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,240
client side features, for the lack of better words. I can't think of them as security control. Sorry,

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm a bit old school there. Exactly. And I think it's important to think about, if you're developing

52
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:06,240
applications, how easy do you want to be able to test them? If you put a whole load of controls in

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,240
that make it hard to test your applications, who are you hurting? Are you really preventing

54
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,320
the bad people from attacking your application, or are you making their own lives harder?

55
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
So it's a balance, and that's a decision you have to make.

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,000
Yeah. And we see that a lot, actually, just to digress for a second. So in the same way that you

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,400
have

58
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:35,920
you know, the mobile space, you can check for a jailbreak on iOS, right? And there are libraries for it and

59
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:41,440
known techniques. And then typically during the retest, a jailbreak risk has either been accepted

60
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,680
or that feature has been included. But then during the scoping, you're like, well, I'm not going to

61
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,880
spend five days bypassing the jailbreak control that I told you to implement. Same with logging.

62
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,040
I'm not going to spend five days focusing on the logging features that I told you to implement.

63
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,680
In essence you end up with a set of techniques that are there in a blue team style where both sides are working

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,200
collaboratively. And surprise, surprise, you might get given a set of tokens in order to be able to

65
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,840
assist and get more value add out of the engagement for the company that you're actively trying to

66
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,920
assist their controls. Definitely. And in things like web application firewalls,

67
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,840
I would recommend they're turned off for a security audit, unless you want to actually test the

68
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,000
web application firewall, which is very valid. But if you want to test the application,

69
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,800
turn off the firewall so that you get as much value as possible out of those tests.

70
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,920
Yeah, yeah. Same with CDNs. Yeah, absolutely.

71
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,320
All of those things. So that was in March, we also carried on with

72
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,840
been doing a lot of work on the automation framework and we actually sported inline scripts,

73
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,360
which we haven't covered in, even though we've done quite a bit of...

74
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,120
Not yet, not yet.

75
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,320
But we will get to those definitely. And another question I asked,

76
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,040
on a blog post was how should we fund ZAP? And we didn't get many responses to that,

77
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,360
which is a shame and something that we'll come back to a little bit later in this podcast,

78
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:17,520
ZAP Chat, whatever it is. So in April, we carried on and we had authentication auto detection.

79
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,480
So this is where we've got a lot more implemented in the authentication helper.

80
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:28,400
So you could actually detect and configure ZAP automatically for many more cases.

81
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,160
And that carried on in May where we actually released the authentication automation,

82
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:42,400
the authentication tester. So very simple screen. Give us a URL, give us the credentials,

83
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,960
and ZAP will try and work out everything else from there. And that has proved that

84
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
there's quite a few applications which ZAP can handle all of these things for you.

85
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,480
Not everything, but it also collects a set of anonymized diagnostic data. So if ZAP can't

86
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,240


87
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,380


88
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,280
detect any part of the authentication into interaction then you can report that to us and

89
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,620
we can have a look at it without you having to tell us all a load of internal details you might

90
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:16,540
not want to. Yeah part of the cat and mouse game that we were just referencing for q1 continued

91
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:23,200
in q2 that was exciting. Definitely and it will carry on no doubt and in then in

92
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,340
actually so yeah that was april. Now may that was when we released the tester, but we also

93
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:34,500
there were some GraphQL changes some significant ones much better spidering and fingerprinting as

94
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,240
well. So you can actually fingerprint the different GraphQL endpoints which was very useful and we

95
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,380
had a change to the AJAX spider where you could exclude specific elements and that was

96
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,540
notable because of the sponsor development something we definitely want to see more of

97
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,200
so thank you to night vision for that

98
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,320
and we would love to do more sponsored developments where companies

99
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,460
pay us to implement really useful features for everyone.

100
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:08,340
Then in june more authentication so this time browser-based authentication in the AJAX spider

101
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:15,500
and this was absolutely key because as we mentioned before it's so hard to inject a session

102
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,720
into a browser and in many cases it's not possible. So this meant that you could launch

103
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,180
the AJAX spider which is

104
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,280
one of our key ways of at the moment it's the only way to explore modern web applications in

105
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:32,200
automation and this allowed you to handle it in authentication which you know we had some blog

106
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,700
posts about things like juice shop. Juice shop was one of the few applications i was able to

107
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,900
inject the session so we're basically running selenium scripts in when we launch the browser

108
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:48,620
and go okay we've got this session token and we'll put it in the is it local storage or

109
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,160
session storage one of those and then refresh the page and it then gets logged in 

110
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:57,300
so you can then explore the application effectively through the browser, but that's unusual.

111
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,700
So browser-based authentication with the AJAX spider is particularly effective and talking of

112
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,700
selenium we actually supported selenium 4 which was very good so we we updated to handle that.

113
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,540
It's always interesting with significant frameworks when they have new releases and you go

114
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:22,020
"okay it's so much better but there's lots of changes we've got to". All the previous api selenium

115
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,740
i have a habit of doing that i remember it's going to show my age, but like selenium one right and it's

116
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,980
like what happened to all the 0.9 api calls? It's like no not there okay cool yeah and you've

117
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,620
got to like rewrite all those things but it's part of the the trade and supporting right and..

118
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,540
Exactly, yeah! ..you've got to do it. Yeah have to do these things and you know we had a lot of problems

119
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,620
with networking layer before that got rewritten to use a more modern library. So we we these are just

120
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,220
of the cost. We also started releasing the docker images on the

121
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,380
github container registry. Which is particularly useful as docker hub started charging quite

122
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:09,220
significant non-trivial amounts of money if you're pulling lots of images and we had we were able to

123
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:15,780
announce two google summer of code projects one on importing postman definitions and the other one

124
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,540
the browser recorder. Which was really great and those completed later on in the year.

125
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,980
July, not much happened on the out on the outside but there's a lot going on behind the scenes

126
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,860
a lot which we announced in august which was the move from OWASP to the software security project.

127
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,700
So this was a really big significant change for us and this comes back to funding.

128
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:52,020
We have found that we need to have people working full-time on ZAP it's such a significant project 

129
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,180
there is so much going on and we've got a lot of volunteers which is great

130
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,900
and volunteers do really useful things but we need people working full-time

131
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,260
and i've been able to work full-time on ZAP thanks to a couple of startups, but

132
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,820
those relationships have not been have not proved to be easy to maintain. So it's quite a cost for a

133
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:21,540
startup and we found we can't rely on them. So what we've done we've joined the software security project

134
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,700
and we were able to get temporary funding for myself and ricardo to work full-time

135
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,580
on ZAP and that is that's the reason we moved. You know we are actually some of us are still both

136
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:40,100
myself and rick are still OWASP project leaders so we still take part in OWASP we sort of contribute

137
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,540
to OWASP but the ZAP project is now part of ssp which is part of the linux foundation.

138
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:51,700
It's really important to just reflect on that for a second and there's no diss to OWASP right and the great work

139
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,900
that is happening at the open web application security project and has been happening for a number of years. The the i remember

140
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:04,340
having this debate when log4j hit right a few years back that december and just listening to

141
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,940
you simon right now just go through the roadmap right there are a number of non-startups like

142
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:14,820
significant companies with massive revenues you know vested share options all that kind of stuff.

143
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:22,020
That have a less impressive roadmap of delivery for 2023 than ZAP has yet there is the expectation

144
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,540
because the project is you know open source and part of the open web application security

145
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,860
project and so on that it will have such a you know progressive roadmap. That has these

146
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,340
aggressive elements authentication and some of the other things that we talked about yet no one

147
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:44,660
is willing to do the checks on the funding and when people back in that december where

148
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,900
dissing you know the apache software foundation with regards to the maintenance of log4j given the

149
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:58,900
black hat talk in 2016 on log4j. It was like hold on like how much money do you think the apache

150
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:05,700
software foundation like accumulated throughout the course of these five years and if you do the

151
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:13,620
math it's trivial compared to the amount of you know big companies financial organizations. So on

152
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
that use these

153
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,980
libraries and take them for granted right. So at some stage i think this whole world of

154
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:30,500
open source software that is worthy you know to be up there with roadmaps as impressive as those of ZAP

155
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,900
need to have that relevant backing. So i think it's only logical that you guys moved and

156
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,500
that is the next step of the evolution of ZAP and perhaps there's another one after that, right?

157
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,740
I completely agree

158
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,420
and it's not just a ZAP problem as you said it's a problem

159
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,140
across a lot of open source projects and ZAP started off as a

160
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,660
a little project for me to try and help teach myself about web security and it just also felt

161
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:05,780
wrong there wasn't that open source project out there and you know we're competing whether we like

162
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:10,580
it or not against commercial companies who have hundreds of employees doing the same thing that

163
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,620
we're doing with two employees at the moment and a lot of volunteers. 

164
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,700


165
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:19,200
So it's challenging, and I'm not expecting to have 100 people working for me.

166
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,300
It would be great, but that's not going to happen.

167
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,760
But just having two of us working full-time on ZAP has made a huge difference,

168
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,520
and I'd love to grow that, but somehow we've got to work out the funding,

169
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,280
and we haven't done that yet.

170
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,340
We've got temporary funding, but, yeah.

171
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,040
I think it's coming down the road, right?

172
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,380
We're working on it.

173
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,180
If you're having 100 employees, so, you know, there's stuff in the works,

174
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,740
so not to be, you know, depressing our audiences in January.

175
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,660
Yeah, completely agree.

176
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,780
And the other thing we did in August was we released a new developer focus questionnaire.

177
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,320
What do you want us to focus on?

178
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,180
Because, you know, we want to make sure that we're focusing on the things

179
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,780
that make a difference to you.

180
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,320
And thank you

181
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,560
to everyone, who filled that in

182
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,440
it was really useful.

183
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,160
In August, we also added support for file transfers in the API.

184
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,880
That's something a lot of people have been asking for,

185
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,620
and that was only available in the core, so it was only available in the weeklies.

186
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,160
But that was, you know, one of the – we were able to do some developments,

187
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
even though there was a lot of stuff going on in the background.

188
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:37,620
And then in September, we carried on working, really working towards 2.14,

189
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,460
the next big release.

190
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,160
And we –

191
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,840
the Google Summer Code students finished,

192
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,760
so both of them completed their project successfully and wrote blog posts on them,

193
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,460
and both of them carried on contributing, which is really great.

194
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,600
And very importantly, we started the ZAP Chat series.

195
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,380
So September is when we started that, and this is actually the 13th episode.

196
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,640
Not unlucky for some, hopefully.

197
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,140
So, yeah, 13 episodes now.

198
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,760
So we've kept going.

199
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,500
And thank you, Yiannis, for keeping on prompting me and saying,

200
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,820
what are we going to do next week?

201
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,360
What are we going to do next week?

202
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,320
And again, okay.

203
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,800
Thank you for your pictures as well.

204
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,060
No, it's been fun.

205
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:17,640
It's been fun.

206
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,540
It's been great to see – you know, I remember the one OWASP project, right,

207
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,340
where tools – the offensive tool set was so much more basic and rudimentary.

208
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,640
And just seeing the great work that you guys are doing with ZAP

209
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,600
to be able to help showcase some of that, you know, it's been a pleasure.

210
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,440
Absolute delight.

211
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,140
And actually, I mean, the reason you got involved was the suggestion of zapIt,

212
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,340
this new reconnaissance scan.

213
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,420


214
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,440
Which we released in October, along with 2.14.

215
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,340
So 2.14, very big release for us.

216
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,800
We're trying to – we're kind of managing two releases a year,

217
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,260
which means I forgot to mention 2.13.

218
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,120
We must have done that earlier in the year.

219
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,460
Oh, well, that's one of those things.

220
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,460
So we did 2.13, so we did two releases this year.

221
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,360
One of the two releases in 2023.

222
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,760
Yeah, absolutely.

223
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:05,520
Yeah.

224
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,700
So that was October.

225
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,140
And in November, quite a lot of – you know,

226
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,900
of focus on documentation videos so a lot more on how to handle modern web applications

227
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,980
authentication with documentation videos around that and we started doing a lot of videos around

228
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,420
the automation framework as well. Which we will carry on we've got many more of those to do.

229
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:35,740
Many jobs are waiting in the pipeline thanks Ricardo. Yep definitely and then in december

230
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:42,060
obviously december's often a bit of a quiet month um but still a lot going on and you know we are

231
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:49,020
really we published the results of the development focus questionnaire. So the top things were

232
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,340
handling modern web apps which is one of our key focuses authentication automation those two are

233
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:01,180
right up there. Then the next ones were ease of use and manual testing and those five were there

234
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,660
wasn't a huge difference between them it wasn't so you know those are the the big five really.

235
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:12,540
And the ease of use one is interesting because it's something we haven't really been able to

236
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,660
focus on and we know that the ZAP desktop gui has kind of drifted a bit and hasn't had much love

237
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:27,260
so one of the things that Yiannis put together was the user persona questionnaire. Well, with the

238
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,820
help of the team right i've been doing by myself and it's more about asking the question of like

239
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,940
"Who are the users of ZAP

240
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,260


241
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:34,420


242
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,860


243
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,080


244
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,220
in the context of the future releases?"

245
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:41,040
So that we can start decluttering the user interface

246
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,680
and potentially get into a flow state

247
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,860
where you go from left to right or cycles

248
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,380
or clockwise, anticlockwise,

249
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,460
whatever the theme might be in the wireframes.

250
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,640
And I think what triggered this for me is

251
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,100
there's a number of features, for example,

252
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,540
when you do automation, right?

253
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,020
Where you click a tiny button, the plus sign,

254
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
to add a plan, right?

255
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,880
And all of a sudden, a whole world appears.

256
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,260
It's as if you've opened a door to a new dimension.

257
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,240
It's like, oh, right, this is cool.

258
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,560
Had I not clicked on this tiny little button, right,

259
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,100
would I know that all this is there?

260
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,960
Yeah, we got to the stage

261
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,880
where ZAP was getting more and more cluttered.

262
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,720
So we then tried to hide things.

263
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,720
And that means you might, it looks a bit complicated,

264
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,740
but you might think that's it, and it's not.

265
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,800
There's loads more.

266
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,440
We were talking about

267
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,100
how we thought, well, what about this user?

268
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,120
And what about this user?

269
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,360
And we were kind of thinking, well,

270
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:40,520
do we really know who's using ZAP

271
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,580
and how they're using it?

272
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,380
And the answer was no.

273
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,740
So many people just download ZAP

274
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,520
and don't get in touch with us, which is fine.

275
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,520
But then it's very difficult for us to go,

276
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,660
right, these are the types of users,

277
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,220
you know, we've got these types of users

278
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,660
and they use ZAP in this way,

279
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,040
so we need to make it better for them.

280
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,260
So this questionnaire is really important to us

281
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,400
because this is the start of us going,

282
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,900
who is using ZAP and what do you want out of it?

283
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,760
And then how can we make it better for you?

284
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,780
And that will be, you know,

285
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,480
that's definitely the desktop GUI,

286
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,880
but there might be other things as well

287
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,460
and might be new features.

288
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,660
There's a whole range of things that will come out of this.

289
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,420
And I'm expecting many more questionnaires as well

290
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:27,160
as we kind of delve into who's using it?

291
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,000
What are you using it for?

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,680
You know, we need to know that in order to make it better.

293
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,840
Because we keep saying, you know,

294
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,380
we've had feedback.

295
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,260
We've had feedback saying the GUI looks outdated

296
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,080
or it's not very good.

297
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,680
It's like, yeah, we kind of know that,

298
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,260
but what do we do about it?

299
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,220
We need very specific things.

300
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,060
And it could be just things about this button is too small

301
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,780
or it could be complete rework of the flow of the application.

302
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,040
So there's, yeah, just telling us it's no good

303
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,860
is helpful, but only so far.

304
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,360
We need to know a lot more

305
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,240
and that's what we're doing with these questionnaires.

306
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,740
Absolutely.

307
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:01,960


308
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:02,340
And just,

309
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,160
you know, just to give a perspective, right?

310
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,560
It's very different what a good GUI will look like

311
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,720
to a pentester or a red teamer.

312
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,380
Yeah.

313
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:14,340
This is a bugbounty hunter versus somebody running it

314
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,620
as part of automation in CI/CD versus somebody in operations, right?

315
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:25,620
It's just a different, completely different style of flow based on,

316
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:29,640
you know, who we are in cybersecurity related fields.

317
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,080
So if you give a really good GUI

318
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,540
to the pentest community, you risk alienating the ops people,

319
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,840
CI/CD, and those who are in the trenches with development teams.

320
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,640
If you do the opposite, right, and you give a really good GUI

321
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,080
to bugbounty hunters, you're probably going to alienate,

322
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,220
you know, some of the pentest folk out there

323
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,840
because they're not after hunting, you know, the tick SQL injection.

324
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,380
They're after hunting very specific bespoke things as part of,

325
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,420
you know, penetration testing.

326
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,920
So,

327
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:06,160
that is where the whole concept of decluttering the GUI

328
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,160
goes back to as an origin, and that's where we need your assistance.

329
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,320
And if I'm not mistaken, Simon, the questionnaire is still open, right?

330
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,460
It is.

331
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,620
Yeah, we still want more.

332
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,480
We've had a lot of responses.

333
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,860
Thank you all who have responded.

334
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,080
But if you haven't, please let us know.

335
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,180
And some people have said they actually like the GUI.

336
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,160
So if we then went and changed everything to work in a completely different way,

337
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,620
we'd piss off those people.

338
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,920
So, you know, it's hard.

339
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,660
It's okay.

340
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,500
We do hard things, but we need to make sure we change things in a way

341
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,800
that makes it better for as many people as possible.

342
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,120
So if you want, if you want your views to be counted,

343
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,200
please fill in that questionnaire and it's on the front of zaproxy.org.

344
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:49,500
And we're nearly out of time.

345
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,520
But one thing I wanted to talk about was 2024 and what's coming next.

346
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,260
And we kind of mentioned that, you know,

347
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,300
you've told us what the development focuses should be,

348
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,500
and those are the things we're focusing on. To be fair,

349
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,340
there were things we thought were important anyway, and we're focusing on.

350
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:10,660
So, but definitely those are where our main focus will be.

351
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,800
But the other one which I've kind of mentioned before is funding.

352
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,500
And I kind of think this is going to be the make or break year for ZAP,

353
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,740
because we need to work out a way of funding,

354
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,260
which means we're not relying on a couple of companies or individuals.

355
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,840
And we've talked about various things. We've got various options.

356
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
But, you know, we haven't solved it yet.

357
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,740
We haven't got the money coming in and, but we still want,

358
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,040
we believe in open source and we want to make sure that ZAP is available to as many people as possible.

359
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:51,180
And that's, you know, our aim is to make the Internet that little bit more secure for everybody.

360
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:57,780
And we believe there should be an open source project like ZAP providing these capabilities.

361
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,840
And if it means we're not as well funded as some

362
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,840
companies with a load of VC funding, that's the way it goes.

363
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,140
You know, we know that. But we think ZAP is providing a huge amount of benefit to the industry.

364
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,340
So how does the industry fund projects like ZAP?

365
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,240
And that's a key question.

366
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,740
And the two are not orthogonal, right?

367
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,040
This is not a, just to be very clear to our audience,

368
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:27,240
this is not an attempt to say, you know, we're going to close the source or we're going to like start licensing everything to death or anything like that.

369
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,840
That's not the objective. The objective is to be able to do

370
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840


371
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,840


372
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,840


373
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,940
what other open source projects have done very successfully in the benefit of, you know, the community

374
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:45,040
in essence. The fact that we have to developers who are partially funded,

375
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,340
full time, though. But partially funded through a mechanism.

376
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:52,140
That is not sustainable. Egers the question,

377
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,640
how do we make this sustainable and grow that development team more?

378
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,240
So this is not an attempt to, by any means,

379
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,640
completely

380
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,000
monetize ZAP and you know take over the world by introducing license fees only

381
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,880
close source everything. No, what we are trying to do is find that balance in 2024 whereby you ask

382
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,260
for a feature it gets delivered but the people that deliver it are actually compensated for their

383
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,580
work right that's the the objective as a bunch of other open source projects have managed to do.

384
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:31,000
Yeah so if you have any ideas about that or if you'd like to donate large sums of money to us

385
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,500
or any sums of money to us. Please get in touch as a our focus is definitely going to be on

386
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,780
new features and modern web applications, authentication, automation ease of use and

387
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:49,220
manual testing as well you know those are you know those are and but we do need to

388
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:55,200
know you know who is using ZAP and how you're using it so that user persona questionnaire is

389
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,560


390
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:55,580


391
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:03,480
really key. So please fill that in and other than that have a great 2024 and we will carry on with these

392
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,300
and probably get back to the automation framework we'll have to have a chat about what we're going

393
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:13,820
to talk about next but stay tuned. Absolutely and happy new year everyone. May all your shells

394
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:18,700
return root as we used to say and that doesn't only mean the cyber world but in life too.

395
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,020
Happy new year folks! Thanks for watching bye.

396
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,200
